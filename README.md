# MTA Subway Wait Times
Subway wait time assessment data courtesy of MTA.  Subway lines are titled using numbers and letters.  The wait assessment is classified as the percent of all trains in which the headway or time between trains is more than 25% of what is scheduled to be according to MTA by month between the years 2015-2019.
All visualizations are interactive.  All visualizations, dashboard, and story can be viewed on this repo using the screenshots.  There is also a packaged Tableau workbook to view the interactive format with the data source. 

From the visualizations, several conclusions can be drawn:
- The 4 train line has the most scheduled "timepoints"
- Off-peak trains have a higher wait assessment percentage (Peak trains run from 7:00am to 10:00am and 4:00pm to 7:00pm during weekdays and 10:00am to 6:00pm on weekends.  All other trains are off-peak.)
- The S Fkln line has the highest average wait assessment, the 4 line has the lowest average wait assessment
- The most common wait assessment is 0.753
